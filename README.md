# JInput-Test

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SnapGames/jinput-test.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/SnapGames/jinput-test) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/777c89cfd1544a2d8ee7b6b5b5fdef85)](https://www.codacy.com/app/SnapGames/jinput-test?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=SnapGames/jinput-test&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This program is a test for the Jinput library intends to read game controller states to integrate with any game.

In this particular test, I implement a specific UI for an XBoxOne controller.

This code is largely inspired from the [Uzo007 post's](https://theuzo007.wordpress.com/2012/09/02/joystick-in-java-with-jinput/)
(Thanks to his code's back from 2012 ;))

I adapted this code to a maven project that can be compiled/started from the command line:

## Build

execute the following line of bash:

    $> mvn clean install

## Execute

input the line below:

    $> mvn exec:java
    
Enjoy !
